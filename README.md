# Home Assistant DHT temperature and humidity sensor

**This is a spin-off from the original Home Assistant integration, which was removed since Home Assistant Core version 2022.4.0.**

The `dht` integration supports the following sensors:

- AM2302
- DHT11
- DHT22

# Installation

### HACS

The recommend way to install `dht` is through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

### Manual installation

Copy the `dht` folder and all of its contents into your Home Assistant's `custom_components` folder. This folder is usually inside your `/config` folder. If you are running Hass.io, use SAMBA to copy the folder over. You may need to create the `custom_components` folder and then copy the `dht` folder and all of its contents into it.
